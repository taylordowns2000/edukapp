This project is about a cross-university widget store, i.e. a repository and community site that focuses on collecting and promoting widgets for learning and teaching. The store will be accompanied with discovery services and will offer easy integration of widgets to personal learning environments while promoting widget capabilities and features. It will offer to end users a sophisticated recommendation engine will promote widgets according to each userâ€™s needs and interaction history. Widget store shall be used by educators as a (centralized) point to focus on any of their initiatives for creating a personal learning environment while for developers a socially-driver platform for widget development. Widget developers will benefit from a framework in place that will be able to monitor widget usage; valuable to detect patterns of activity in a personal learning environment.
